## Description

This simple command-line application demonstrates how to invoke Google
Vision API from PHP.

## Build and Run
1.  **Enable APIs** - [Enable the Vision API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=vision.googleapis.com)
    and create a new project or select an existing project.
2.  **Download The Credentials** - Click "Go to credentials" after enabling the APIs. Click "New Credentials"
    and select "Service Account Key". Create a new service account, use the JSON key type, and
    select "Create". Once downloaded, set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
    to the path of the JSON key that was downloaded.
3.  **Clone the repo** and cd into this directory
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/php-docs-samples
    $ cd php-docs-samples/vision
```
4.  **Install dependencies** via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
    Run `php composer.phar install` (if composer is installed locally) or `composer install`
    (if composer is installed globally).
5.  For a basic demonstration of the Cloud Vision API, run `php quickstart.php`.
6.  Run `php vision.php`. The following commands are available:
```
  face           Detect faces in an image using Google Cloud Vision API
  help           Displays help for a command
  label          Detect labels in an image using Google Cloud Vision API
  landmark       Detect landmarks in an image using Google Cloud Vision API
  list           Lists commands
  logo           Detect logos in an image using Google Cloud Vision API
  property       Detect image proerties in an image using Google Cloud Vision API
  safe-search    Detect adult content in an image using Google Cloud Vision API
  text           Detect text in an image using Google Cloud Vision API
  crop-hints     Detect crop hints in an image using Google Cloud Vision API
  document-text  Detect document text in an image using Google Cloud Vision API
  web            Detect web entities in an image using Google Cloud Vision API
  web-geo        Detect web entities in an image with geo metadata using
                 Google Cloud Vision API
```
7. Run `php vision.php COMMAND --help` to print information about the usage of each command.

## The client library

This sample uses the [Google Cloud Client Library for PHP][google-cloud-php].
You can read the documentation for more details on API usage and use GitHub
to [browse the source][google-cloud-php-source] and [report issues][google-cloud-php-issues].

## Troubleshooting

If you get the following error, set the environment variable `GCLOUD_PROJECT` to your project ID:

```
[Google\Cloud\Core\Exception\GoogleException]
No project ID was provided, and we were unable to detect a default project ID.
```

If you have not set a timezone you may get an error from php. This can be resolved by:

  1. Finding where the php.ini is stored by running `php -i | grep 'Configuration File'`
  1. Finding out your timezone from the list on this page: http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
  1. Editing the php.ini file (or creating one if it doesn't exist)
  1. Adding the timezone to the php.ini file e.g., adding the following line: `date.timezone = "America/Los_Angeles"`
